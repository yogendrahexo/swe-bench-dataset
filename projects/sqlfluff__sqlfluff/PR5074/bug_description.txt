Inconsistent output depending on --processes flag when --ignore linting is used
### Search before asking

- [X] I searched the [issues](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/issues) and found no similar issues.


### What Happened

Depending on the value you set for the `--processes` flag when also using `--ignore linting`, different output with different exit codes are generated.

### Expected Behaviour

The same exit code should be generated, independently of the `--processes` flag. Furthermore, from https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/production.html#using-sqlfluff-on-a-whole-sql-codebase I would expect that exit codes should be either `0` or `65`, not `1`.

### Observed Behaviour

See the How to reproduce section.

### How to reproduce

Create a `test.sql` file with the following content:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE example (
    id TEXT DEFAULT 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. In condimentum congue est, ac orci aliquam.' PRIMARY KEY
);
```

The line is too long according to SQLFluff, caused by the large default value, so let's see the the output of SQLFluff.

Running

```SHELL
sqlfluff fix --dialect postgres --ignore linting --processes 2
```

results in 

```
==== finding fixable violations ====
==== no fixable linting violations found ====                                                                                                                                                                      
All Finished üìú üéâ!
  [1 unfixable linting violations found]
```

with exit code `1`. Running the same with one process instead:

```SHELL
sqlfluff fix --dialect postgres --ignore linting --processes 1
```

results in

```
==== finding fixable violations ====
==== no fixable linting violations found ====                                                                                                                                                                      
All Finished üìú üéâ!
```

and exit code `0`

Same behaviour for `lint` and `format` commands.

Hints:
This is _very_ interesting! I'll pick this one up üëç 
It's worth calling out that I think part of the problem here is that the docs are also out of date - but you're still right that the return codes should be _the same_ regardless of the `processes` setting.
