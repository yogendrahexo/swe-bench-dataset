Number of processes configurable in .sqlfluff
Being able to set the number of processes to run with in .sqlfluff might be useful to avoid having to pass it in the CLI every time.


Hints:
One thought on this: The same `.sqlfluff` file will sometimes be used on different machines (e.g. various development machines, CI server). We should allow the setting to be somewhat "context sensitive" if desired. Proposal:
* Positive values indicate the number of processes to create
* Zero or negative values are interpreted as `number_of_cpus - specified_number`. Thus, a value of `0` means "use all processors" and `-1` means "use all processors except one".
Is there a standard way in python to detect the effective available cpus?
@alanmcruickshank: Yes. Use [`multiprocessing.cpu_count()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.cpu_count).
I'm happy to pick this one up. This actually fits with a small reorg of how I think threads should be configured. I think it fits better if the thread argument is passed in to the `Linter` object on instantiation, rather than when calling `lint_paths`. @barrywhart - does that sit well with you? I realise that changes a little of the structure you originally envisaged.
Sounds good -- no concerns from me.
