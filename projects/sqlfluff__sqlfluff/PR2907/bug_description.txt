sqlfluff doesn't recognise a jinja variable set inside of "if" statement
### Search before asking

- [X] I searched the [issues](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/issues) and found no similar issues.


### What Happened

When I try to define a jinja variable using "set" jinja directive inside of an "if" jinja statement, sqlfluff complains: 
"Undefined jinja template variable".

### Expected Behaviour

to not have a linting issue

### Observed Behaviour

sqlfluff lint gives an error:
"Undefined jinja template variable"

### How to reproduce

try to create a "temp.sql" file with the following content

```
{% if True %}
    {% set some_var %}1{% endset %}
    SELECT {{some_var}}
{% endif %}
```

and run:
```
sqlfluff lint ./temp.sql
```

You will get the following error:
```
== [./temp.sql] FAIL                                                                                                                    
L:   2 | P:  12 |  TMP | Undefined jinja template variable: 'some_var'
L:   3 | P:  14 |  TMP | Undefined jinja template variable: 'some_var'

Hints:
Does Jinja support this? I don't see how this could be a SQLFluff issue.
Your example does work on this website. I wonder if there's a Jinja runtime setting that affects whether this works.

http://jinja.quantprogramming.com/
It also works with `j2cli` on my local machine. Seems like this _has_ to be a Jinja runtime setting...

https://github.com/kolypto/j2cli
It was added in Jinja 2.8: https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/#block-assignments

Not sure what version we pull in depending on our other dependencies?

I'm digging into this more. SQLFluff contains some additional code that attempts to detect undeclared Jinja variables and provide better error handling. The "issue" is being detected and reported by that code, not by Jinja itself. So we should be able to fix this. Need to do this carefully so we don't break error reporting for real errors. 
I think I have a fix. Just need to make the undefined variable check more sophisticated.
