dbt postgres fix command errors with UnicodeEncodeError and also wipes the .sql file
_If this is a parsing or linting issue, please include a minimal SQL example which reproduces the issue, along with the `sqlfluff parse` output, `sqlfluff lint` output and `sqlfluff fix` output when relevant._

## Expected Behaviour
Violation failure notice at a minimum, without wiping the file. Would like a way to ignore the known error at a minimum as --noqa is not getting past this. Actually would expect --noqa to totally ignore this.

## Observed Behaviour
Reported error: `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2192' in position 120: character maps to <undefined>`

## Steps to Reproduce
SQL file:
```sql
SELECT
    reacted_table_name_right.descendant_id AS category_id,
    string_agg(redacted_table_name_left.name, ' â†’ ' ORDER BY reacted_table_name_right.generations DESC) AS breadcrumbs -- noqa
FROM {{ ref2('redacted_schema_name', 'redacted_table_name_left') }} AS redacted_table_name_left
INNER JOIN {{ ref2('redacted_schema_name', 'reacted_table_name_right') }} AS reacted_table_name_right
    ON redacted_table_name_left.id = order_issue_category_hierarchies.ancestor_id
GROUP BY reacted_table_name_right.descendant_id
```
Running `sqlfluff fix --ignore templating,parsing,lexing -vvvv` and accepting proposed fixes for linting violations.

Hints:
I get a dbt-related error -- can you provide your project file as well? Also, what operating system are you running this on? I tested a simplified (non-dbt) version of your file on my Mac, and it worked okay.

```
dbt.exceptions.DbtProjectError: Runtime Error
  no dbt_project.yml found at expected path /Users/bhart/dev/sqlfluff/dbt_project.yml
```
Never mind the questions above -- I managed to reproduce the error in a sample dbt project. Taking a look now...
@Tumble17: Have you tried setting the `encoding` parameter in `.sqlfluff`? Do you know what encoding you're using? The default is `autodetect`, and SQLFluff "thinks" the file uses "Windows-1252" encoding, which I assume is incorrect -- that's why SQLFluff is unable to write out the updated file.
I added this line to the first section of your `.sqlfluff`, and now it seems to work. I'll look into changing the behavior of `sqlfluff fix` so it doesn't erase the file when it fails.

```
encoding = utf-8
```
