"""Implements the base rule class.

Rules crawl through the trees returned by the parser and evaluate particular
rules.

The intent is that it should be possible for the rules to be expressed
as simply as possible, with as much of the complexity abstracted away.

The evaluation function should take enough arguments that it can evaluate
the position of the given segment in relation to its neighbors, and that
the segment which finally "triggers" the error, should be the one that would
be corrected OR if the rule relates to something that is missing, then it
should flag on the segment FOLLOWING, the place that the desired element is
missing.
