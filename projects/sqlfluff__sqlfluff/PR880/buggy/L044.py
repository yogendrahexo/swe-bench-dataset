    | **Anti-pattern**
    | Querying all columns using `*` produces a query result where the number
    | or ordering of columns changes if the upstream table's schema changes.
    | This should generally be avoided because it can cause slow performance,
    | cause important schema changes to go undetected, or break production code.
    | For example:
    | * If a query does `SELECT t.*` and is expected to return columns `a`, `b`,
    |   and `c`, the actual columns returned will be wrong/different if columns
    |   are added to or deleted from the input table.
    | * `UNION` and `DIFFERENCE` clauses require the inputs have the same number
    |   of columns (and compatible types).
    | * `JOIN` queries may break due to new column name conflicts, e.g. the
    |   query references a column "c" which initially existed in only one input
    |   table but a column of the same name is added to another table.
    | * `CREATE TABLE (<<column schema>>) AS SELECT *`

        WITH cte AS (

        )

        SELECT * FROM cte
        UNION
        SELECT a, b FROM t

    | **Best practice**
    | Somewhere along the "path" to the source data, specify columns explicitly.

    .. code-block::

        WITH cte AS (
            SELECT * FROM foo
        )
