Config for fix_even_unparsable not being applied
### Search before asking

- [X] I searched the [issues](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/issues) and found no similar issues.


### What Happened

When setting the any config file to `fix_even_unparsable = True` the config get's overriden by the default (or lack thereof) on the @click.option decorator for the fix command.

### Expected Behaviour

When setting the config `fix_even_unparsable` it should be captured by the fix command as well.

### Observed Behaviour

The `fix_even_unparsable` command is not being captured by the fix command

### How to reproduce

Create a config file and include `fix_even_unparsable`
Run `sqlfluff fix`
Note that `fix_even_unparsable` is set to False at runtime

### Dialect

Hints:
I believe the fix would be to just add a `default=None,` to the @click.option decorator.
This is simple enough for me to create a PR but I don't know how to create tests (or if just adding it is enough) for it as required on the PR template.

Confirmed that worked

It would be good to have a test. If you look at `test/fixtures/linter/autofix/snowflake/001_semi_structured` you can see a similar test that uses a .sqlfluff config file for the test run.
I'm happy to take this unless you want to do it, @pekapa. I fixed a very similar issue with the `--encoding` option a few weeks ago.
