BigQuery: Accessing `STRUCT` elements evades triggering L027
### Search before asking

- [X] I searched the [issues](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/issues) and found no similar issues.


### What Happened

Accessing unreferenced `STRUCT` elements using BigQuery dot notation in a multi table query does not trigger L027.

### Expected Behaviour

L027 gets triggered.

### Observed Behaviour

L027 does not get triggered.

### How to reproduce

```sql
SELECT
    t1.col1,
    t2.col2,
    events.id
FROM t_table1 AS t1
LEFT JOIN t_table2 AS t2
    ON TRUE
```

Hints:
This is tricky.

Basicaly L026 works to make sure qualified columns only use tables in the from clause. This doesn’t really work for `STRUCT`s as impossible to know if it’s a qualified column or a `STRUCT`, so is off by default for languages that support them - like BigQuery.

L027 works to make sure columns are qualified for multi-table joins (i.e. have at least one dot). But it doesn’t check the qualifiers are valid - that’s L026’s job, which as I say is off by default for BigQuery.
