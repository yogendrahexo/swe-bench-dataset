Suppress dbt logs and warnings when using --format github-annotation
Sometimes, running:
```
sqlfluff lint --format github-annotation --annotation-level failure --nofail 
```

Can result in the first couple of output lines being logs which break the annotations, for example:
```
14:21:42  Partial parse save file not found. Starting full parse.
Warning:  [WARNING]: Did not find matching node for patch with name 'xxxx' in the 'models' section of file 'models/production/xxxxx/xxxxx.yml'
```

## Version
dbt 1.0.0, SQLFLuff 0.9.0



Hints:
my workaround was to add `sed -i '/^\[/!d' annotations.json` to the git actions command to delete the extra lines from dbt that were not part of the annotations beginning with `[`
Perhaps the better solution here is to add an ability for SQLFluff to write an annotations.json file itself with a command like
```
sqlfluff lint --format github-annotation --annotation-level failure --nofail ${{ steps.get_files_to_lint.outputs.lintees }} --write-output annotations.json
```
which would still allow the user to see log outputs, rather than the user having to stream the logs into a file with:

```
sqlfluff lint --format github-annotation --annotation-level failure --nofail ${{ steps.get_files_to_lint.outputs.lintees }} > annotations.json
```

@NiallRees: That sounds like a great suggestion -- I had the same thought. I was the original author of the `github-annotation` format, and it seemed natural to add it to the existing list of formats. TBH, of the 4 formats, only one is intended for humans. If we make this change, I suggest we consider changing all the formats to support this.
