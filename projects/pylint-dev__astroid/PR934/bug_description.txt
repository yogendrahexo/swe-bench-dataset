error during inference of class inheriting from another with `mod.Type` format
Consider package a `level` with a class `Model` defined in `level`'s `__init__.py` file.

```
class Model:
    data: int = 1
```

If a class `Test` inherits from `Model` as `class Test(Model)`, and `Model` comes from `from level import Model`,  then inferring `Test.data` works fine (below, A is an alias for astroid).

However, if a `Test` inherits from `Model` as `class Test(level.Model)` and `level` comes from `import level`, then inference triggers an exception.
