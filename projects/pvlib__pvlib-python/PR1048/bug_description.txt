So almost 100 lines of warnings.


Hints:
Not bugs per se, the algorithm handles non-convergence when looping through the IV curves by continuing, although the rattling and squeaks are audible. I'd prefer to keep that behavior and silencing divide by 0 and invalid (nan) value warnings in place, if that's OK.
No problem with the algorithm, just its rattles and squeaks. Does it need to emit its own more useful warnings?
It could, but the causes for non-convergence may not be easy to identify and state. The returned dict includes a Boolean array that is False for IV curves for which it didn't get parameters. It could warn that the array is non-empty, but that seems unnecessary to me.
