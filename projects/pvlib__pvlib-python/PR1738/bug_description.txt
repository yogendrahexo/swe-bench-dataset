`pvlib.soiling.hsu` takes `tilt` instead of `surface_tilt`
`pvlib.soiling.hsu` takes a `tilt` parameter representing the same thing we normally call `surface_tilt`:

I don't see any good reason for this naming inconsistency (I suspect `tilt` just got copied from the matlab implementation) and suggest we rename the parameter to `surface_tilt` with a deprecation.

Also, the docstring parameter type description says it must be `float`, but the model's reference explicitly says time series tilt is allowed: 

> The angle is variable for tracking systems and is taken as the average angle over the time step.




Hints:
On second thought, I'm not seeing how this can be deprecated without reordering the parameters, which doesn't seem worth it to me.  I'm inclined to rename it without deprecation in 0.10.0.
