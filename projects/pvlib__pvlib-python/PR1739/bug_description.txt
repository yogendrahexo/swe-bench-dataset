`pvlib.iotools.get_pvgis_hourly`'s `surface_azimuth` parameter doesn't use pvlib's azimuth convention
Nearly everything in pvlib represents azimuth angles as values in [0, 360) clockwise from north, except `pvlib.iotools.get_pvgis_hourly`:

This inconsistency is a shame.  However, I don't see any way to switch it to pvlib's convention without a hard break, which is also a shame.  I wonder how others view the cost/benefit analysis here.

Hints:
Since `get_pvgis_hourly` is only using `surface_azimuth` to pass a value to a pvgis keyword `aspect`, we could add `aspect` with the South=0 convention and deprecate `surface_azimuth` as is. Then later, we can deprecate `aspect` and add `surface_azimuth` back with its pvlib meaning. Now that I write that out, seems better just to make the breaking change.
