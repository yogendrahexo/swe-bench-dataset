Add `min_angle` argument to `tracking.singleaxis`
In `tracking.singleaxis` the minimum angle of the tracker is assumed to be opposite of the maximum angle, although in some cases the minimum angle could be different. NREL SAM doesn't support that but PVsyst does.

In order to support non symmetrical limiting angles, `tracking.singleaxis` should have another, optional, input, `min_angle`. By default, if not supplied (i.e. value is `None`), the current behavior (`min_angle = -max_angle`) would apply.

Can I propose a PR for this, with modifications to `tracking.singleaxis`, `tracking.SingleAxisTracker` and to `pvsystem.SingleAxisTrackerMount` + corresponding tests?


Hints:
I'm in favor of pvlib being able to handle asymmetrical rotation limits in principle, but I'm curious what situation has that asymmetry in practice.  @MichalArieli do you have a particular real-world application in mind?

Rather than separate `min_` and `max_` parameters, I think I'd favor a single parameter that accepts a tuple as @cwhanse suggested here: https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/pull/823#issuecomment-561399605.  I'm not sure about renaming `max_angle` to something else though.  `singleaxis(..., max_angle=(-40, 45))` seems okay to me.  And since symmetrical limits is by far the more common case, I think the parameter should continue accepting a single value (in which case symmetry is assumed) in addition to a tuple.

`tracking.SingleAxisTracker` is being removed anyway (#1771), so no point in making any additions there.  Whatever changes we decide on here should only be made to `tracking.singleaxis` and `pvsystem.SingleAxisTrackerMount` (and tests, of course).
@kandersolar  Thanks for the quick response! 

Regarding handling asymmetry in rotation limits, let's take the example of a tracker placed at a 90-degree axis azimuth, tracking south-north. If the sun is at azimuth 80 degrees during sunrise, the algorithm will guide the tracker to briefly turn north. To prevent that we can implement a maximum angle limit for northward movement to ensure smooth and continuous motion and taking into account the time needed for such a large angular change.

I agree its better to have a single parameter that accepts a tuple/ single value. Would you like me to apply these changes and send for a PR?
