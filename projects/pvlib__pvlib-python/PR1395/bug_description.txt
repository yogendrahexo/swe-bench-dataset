<!-- Brief description of the problem and proposed solution (if not already fully described in the issue linked to above): -->

The proposed function retrieves the local horizon profile for a specific location (latitude, longitude, and elevation). The returned horizon profile has a resolution of 1 degree in the azimuth direction. The service is provided by MINES ParisTech though I cannot find any official documentation for it.

The function added in this PR (``pvlib.iotools.get_mines_horizon``) is very similar to the function added in #1395 (``pvlib.iotools.get_pvgis_horizon``).


Hints:
@mikofski @cwhanse I saw your discussions in #758 and #1290 and figured I'd share the code I had laying around for downloading the local horizon profile from SRTM. Does this have any interest to you?
I'm lovin' this! Could we also look into retrieving pvgis horizon data, how do they compare to the SRTM from MINES?
