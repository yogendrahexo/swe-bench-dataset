Cell wise and dimension reducing filters do not work for PointSet
### Describe the bug, what's wrong, and what you expected.

`PointSet` is an odd data type as it has no cells and simply represents a 0-dimensional geometry: point clouds.

This means that two common types of operations are not possible on this data type:

1. Cell-wise operations like thresholding
2. Dimension-reducing operations like contouring

Cell wise operations can easily be fixed by adding cells. This can be done with `cast_to_polydata()`

Dimension-reducing operations, on the other hand, have no solution and should not be allowed on `PointSet`.

How can we properly error out or convert to `PolyData` when calling dataset filters like `threshold()` and `contour()`? Should these types of filters be overridden on the `PointSet` class?

### Steps to reproduce the bug.

### Cell wise operation produces *invalid* output

```python
import pyvista as pv
import numpy as np
pc = pv.PointSet(np.random.random((100, 3)))
pc['foo'] = np.arange(pc.n_points)
pc.threshold()
```

### Dimension reducing operation produces *no* output

```py
import pyvista as pv
import numpy as np
pc = pv.PointSet(np.random.random((100, 3)))
pc['foo'] = np.arange(pc.n_points)
pc.contour()
```
