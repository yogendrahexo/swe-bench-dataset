to_tetrahedra active scalars
### Describe the bug, what's wrong, and what you expected.

#4311 passes cell data through the `to_tetrahedra` call. However, after these changes.  The active scalars information is lost.

cc @akaszynski who implemented these changes in that PR.

### Steps to reproduce the bug.

```py
import pyvista as pv
import numpy as np
mesh = pv.UniformGrid(dimensions=(10, 10, 10))
mesh["a"] = np.zeros(mesh.n_cells)
mesh["b"] = np.ones(mesh.n_cells)
print(mesh.cell_data)
tet = mesh.to_tetrahedra()
print(tet.cell_data)
```

Hints:
First, these lines should reset the active_scalars to the last scalars added to the tetrahedral mesh:

https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista/blob/a87cf37d9cea6fc68d8099a56d86ded8f6e78734/pyvista/core/filters/rectilinear_grid.py#L119-L123

These subsequent lines pop out the active scalars, which is somehow the blank scalars, and set it as "vtkOriginalCellIds".

Edit: I am wrong the first set of lines, would only set active scalars if there are none present, but the unnamed scalars are active.  We just need to reset the active scalars according to the original mesh I think.
Good point. Thanks @MatthewFlamm for pointing this out. We'll have this added in the v0.39.1 patch.
