OverflowError "VR of 'DS' must be <= 16 characters long" triggered when element is 16 characters long
**Describe the bug**

`OverflowError` triggered while accessing `PixelData`, which the values compliant with the standard. In the sample referenced in the example below, we have this, which satisfies DS VR:

```
(0028,0030) DS [.002006091181818\.002006091181818]      #  34, 2 PixelSpacing
```

But nevertheless the error is triggered while trying to access `PixelData`:

```
OverflowError: Values for elements with a VR of 'DS' must be <= 16 characters long, 
but the float provided requires > 16 characters to be accurately represented. Use a 
smaller string, set 'config.settings.reading_validation_mode' to 'WARN' to override 
the length check, or explicitly construct a DS object with 'auto_format' set to True
```

**Expected behavior**

`OverflowError` does not get triggered.

Hints:
For reference, a possibly similar issue came up in dcmjs: https://github.com/dcmjs-org/dcmjs/issues/175
I had a quick look, and the problem seems to be that the length is not taken from the original string, but from the string representation, which in this case adds a leading zero... This check has been introduced in pydicom 2.2.0.
