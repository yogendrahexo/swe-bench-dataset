Error writing values with VR OF
[Related to this comment](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/issues/452#issuecomment-614038937) (I think)

```python
from pydicom.dataset import Dataset
ds = Dataset()
ds.is_little_endian = True
ds.is_implicit_VR = True
ds.FloatPixelData = b'\x00\x00\x00\x00'
ds.save_as('out.dcm')
```
```

[Error in filewriter](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/blob/master/pydicom/filewriter.py#L1007) using `write_numbers` instead of `write_OBvalue`/`write_OWvalue`. Looks like it's been wrong [since 2008](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/commit/5d3ea61ffe6877ae79267bf233f258c07c726998). I'm a bit surprised it hasn't come up before.
