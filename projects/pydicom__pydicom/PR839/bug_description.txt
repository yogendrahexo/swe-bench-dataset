Ambiguous VR element could be read in <=1.1.0 but is broken in >=1.2.0

#### Description
Attribute Error thrown when printing (0x0028, 0x0120) PixelPaddingValue

#### Steps/Code to Reproduce
Using pydicom 1.2.2 and above (including master branch as of issue creation date):
```
from pydicom import dcmread

ds = dcmread('rtss.dcm')
ds

Exception in thread Thread-1:

```

Anonymized RTSTRUCT file is attached: [RTSTRUCT.zip](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom/files/3124625/RTSTRUCT.zip)

#### Expected Results
The dataset is printed. This worked in pydicom 1.1.0 and below.

Since `PixelRepresentation` is not defined in the dataset, this attribute cannot be printed anymore.

What's strange is that according to the standard PixelPaddingValue (0028, 0120) is 1C for RTSTRUCT, but in this file it has no other tags referencing PixelData. So it probably should not have been included by the vendor.

I am wondering if there should be another path like in #809 that can handle the missing PixelRepresentation attribute.

#### Actual Results
```AttributeError: Failed to resolve ambiguous VR for tag (0028, 0120): 'FileDataset' object has no attribute 'PixelRepresentation'```

#### Versions
```
Darwin-17.7.0-x86_64-i386-64bit
Python 3.7.0 (default, Jul 23 2018, 20:22:55) 
[Clang 9.1.0 (clang-902.0.39.2)]
pydicom 1.2.2
```


Hints:
Hm, in this case `PixelPadding` doesn't make sense, as there is no `PixelData` present, so we could just ignore it (e.g. use some default VR). With `PixelData` present, a missing `PixelRepresentation` would be a real DICOM violation, that would justify an exception as with the current behavior in my opinion. 
The same is true for all tags with ambiguous VR dependent on `PixelRepresentation`.
If this is sufficient, I can put together a respective PR.
