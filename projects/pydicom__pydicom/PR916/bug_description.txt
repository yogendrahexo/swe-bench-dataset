#### Description
<!-- Example: Attribute Error thrown when printing (0x0010, 0x0020) patient Id> 0-->

When converting a dataset to json the following error occurs.
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/threading.py", line 916, in _bootstrap_inner
    self.run()
  File "/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/threading.py", line 864, in run
    self._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs)
  File "~/pacs-proxy/pacs/service.py", line 172, in saveFunction
    jsonObj = ds.to_json()
  File "~/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pydicom/dataset.py", line 2046, in to_json
    dump_handler=dump_handler
  File "~/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pydicom/dataelem.py", line 447, in to_json
    if len(elem_value.components) > 2:
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'components'
```
#### Steps/Code to Reproduce

ds = pydicom.dcmread("testImg")
jsonObj = ds.to_json()

I'm working on getting an anonymous version of the image, will update. But any advice, suggestions would be appreciated.

Hints:
Thanks for the report! 
For some reason, the value is not a `PersonName3` instance, as expected, but a string - this is obviously a bug. No need to provide a test dataset, as this is reproducible with existing test data. I will have a look tonight.
Awesome. Thank you very much. This is the last hurdle for our project. :D
