apply_voi_lut - unclear what it does if both WL/VOILUTFunction _and_ VOILUTSequence are present
https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev/reference/generated/pydicom.pixel_data_handlers.util.html#pydicom.pixel_data_handlers.util.apply_voi_lut

Hi all,

I'm working with some mammo image (digital) that have both 
- window/level (0028,1050 0028,1051) plus VOILUTFunction (0028,1056) (set to SIGMOID) (set of 3 WL values)
- VOILUT sequences (0028, 3010)

specified.

Problem
---

It's unclear from the documentation when both a VOILUT (0028,3010) _and_ WL (0028,1051...) are present which is applied - the lut or the wl.

It just says if a LUT's present, it will apply that, and if a WL set is present it will apply that.

Questions
---

- If both LUT and WL are supplied, by the dicom standard, which should be applied?
- Separately to the above question about which is applied, if _both_ LUT and WL sequences are supplied, is there a way in `apply_voi_lut` to specify applying one or the other?  (ie force application of the WL instead of LUT etc)

- Also, if an image has a sequence of WL values rather than being single valued (so 0028,1050 & 0028,1051 are sequences), does the `index` parameter to `apply_voi_lut` apply to specify which in the sequence you want to use?

Thanks!

apply_voi_lut can't handle missing DICOM meta info
I have encountered two real life examples where `apply_voi_lut` does not handle corruption in DICOM meta fields

case 1:
```
(0028, 1050) Window Center                       DS: "128.0"
(0028, 1051) Window Width                        DS: "256.0"
(0028, 1052) Rescale Intercept                   DS: None
(0028, 1053) Rescale Slope                       DS: None
```
throws an exception

```
  File "python3.7/site-packages/pydicom/pixel_data_handlers/util.py", line 380, in apply_voi_lut
    y_min = y_min * ds.RescaleSlope + ds.RescaleIntercept
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'int' and 'NoneType' 
```


case 2:

```
(0028, 1050) Window Center                       DS: "2607.0"
(0028, 1051) Window Width                        DS: "2785.0"
(0028, 1052) Rescale Intercept                   DS: "0.0"
(0028, 1053) Rescale Slope                       DS: "1.0"
(0028, 1054) Rescale Type                        LO: 'US'
(0028, 2110) Lossy Image Compression             CS: '00'
(0028, 3010)  VOI LUT Sequence   1 item(s) ---- 
   (0028, 3002) LUT Descriptor                      SS: None
   (0028, 3003) LUT Explanation                     LO: 'Noramal'
   (0028, 3006) LUT Data                            OW: None
```

throws an exception

```
  File "python3.7/site-packages/pydicom/pixel_data_handlers/util.py", line 312, in apply_voi_lut
    nr_entries = item.LUTDescriptor[0] or 2**16
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
```


So far I have handled this with:

```
    def _lut_convert(self):
        return apply_voi_lut(self.input_dicom.pixel_array, self.input_dicom)

    def _get_raw_data(self):

        # convert to presentation LUT
        try:
            data = self._lut_convert()
        # many things can be corrupted in the VOILUTSequence attribute,
        # fall back to default WC/WW conversion
        except Exception as e:
            try:
                if "VOILUTSequence" in self.input_dicom:
                    del self.input_dicom["VOILUTSequence"]
                    data = self._lut_convert()
            except Exception as e:
                raise InvalidImage(f"Could not convert to presentation LUT due to: {e}")
```

While the case 1 could be seen as an expected behavior (?), I imagine case 2 should be handled by WC/WW transformations if followed DICOM standard?











Hints:
For some reason when I wrote it, I assumed it was a case of either/or for *VOI LUT Sequence*/*Window Center*, but now that I look at the Standard again I see it possible that both can be present (although only one can be applied). I'll probably add a flag to allow selecting which one is used when both are present.

That should be up to the user

> Separately to the above question about which is applied, if both LUT and WL sequences are supplied, is there a way in apply_voi_lut to specify applying one or the other? (ie force application of the WL instead of LUT etc)

Not at the moment, although you could force which is applied by deleting the corresponding element(s) for the operation you don't want

> Also, if an image has a sequence of WL values rather than being single valued (so 0028,1050 & 0028,1051 are sequences), does the index parameter to apply_voi_lut apply to specify which in the sequence you want to use?

Yes
Is it possible that you could attach an anonymised dataset we could add to our test data? It'd be helpful to have a real dataset.
